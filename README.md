# Budget Prediction

This project provides a machine learning solution for analyzing and predicting budget-related data, using a RandomForest algorithm. It is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, encompassing model training, a Flask API for predictions, and a Streamlit frontend for user interaction.

## Overview

The repository is structured into three primary Python scripts:

- `model.py`: Handles the training of the machine learning model. It processes input data, trains a RandomForest model, and saves both the model and its scaler to disk.
- `api.py`: Implements a Flask API that serves predictions. This API loads the trained model from disk and uses it to predict based on incoming requests.
- `frontend.py`: A Streamlit application that provides a graphical interface. Users can input data directly, which is then sent to the Flask API to retrieve predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip and virtualenv (optional for setting up a virtual environment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the 1.0.2 folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ismat-Samadov/Budget_Prediction.git
   cd Budget_Prediction/1.0.5
   ```

2. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Model Training**:
   Execute `model.py` to train the model and save it, along with its scaler:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

2. **Start the Flask API**:
   Ensure the model files are available, then launch the API with:
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```
   The API will listen for and respond to prediction requests.

3. **Launch the Streamlit Frontend**:
   With the API running, initiate the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```
   This opens a web interface where users can input data and receive predictions in real-time.

### Live Application

Access the live application at: [Budget Analyse on Streamlit](https://budgett.streamlit.app/). This provides an interactive platform to explore the functionalities of the tool.
