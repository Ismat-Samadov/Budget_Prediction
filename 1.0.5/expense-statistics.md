## Analysis Insights

1. **Distribution Characteristics**: 
   - The data is extremely right-skewed (skewness = 25.67), meaning there are a few very large expenses but most are much smaller.
   - The extremely high kurtosis (767.29) indicates the presence of severe outliers.
   - The mean (15.59) is significantly higher than the median (7.10), confirming the right skew.

2. **Variability**:
   - The very high coefficient of variation (486.04%) shows that the data has extreme variability relative to its mean.
   - The standard deviation (75.78) is nearly 5 times larger than the mean, indicating widely dispersed values.

3. **Concentration of Values**:
   - 99.7% of all expense values (4,582 out of 4,597) fall in the lowest bin (0.05-250.04).
   - Only 15 expenses (0.3%) are over 250.00.
   - There are a few extreme outliers in the 2000-2500 range.

4. **Quartile Analysis**:
   - 75% of all expenses are 11.50 or less.
   - The middle 50% of expenses fall between 4.00 and 11.50 (relatively tight range).
   - The outliers are dramatically affecting the overall statistics.

This analysis suggests that for budgeting purposes, it might be better to analyze this data after removing extreme outliers, or to segment the expenses into categories (e.g., regular expenses vs. major purchases).
